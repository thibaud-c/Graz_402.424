# Exercise Guide: Working with APIs

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will practice working with APIs. You will use the requests library to make API calls and process the responses.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another. It is extremely useful for developers but also GIS experts to access data and services from other applications.

## Installation

You will need to install the requests library to make API calls. You can install it using pip:

```bash
apt-get install curl
apt-get install jq
```
